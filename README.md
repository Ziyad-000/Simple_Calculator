# Calculator Application README

## Overview
This is a simple and visually appealing calculator application designed with a dark theme and vibrant orange highlights for key functions. It supports basic arithmetic operations along with some advanced functions. This application is built using **Kivy**, a powerful and flexible Python framework for developing cross-platform applications.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (x), Division (/)
- **Advanced Operations:**
  - Power (Pow)
  - Percentage (%)
  - Pi (π)
- **Decimal Support:** Allows input of decimal numbers
- **Clear Function:** "AC" button clears the current input
- **Result Calculation:** "=" button computes the entered expression

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language for logic
- **Kivy:** Framework used for building the user interface and managing events

## Button Layout
```
AC    Pow    %    /
7     8      9    x
4     5      6    -
1     2      3    +
π     0      .    =
```

## How to Use
1. Click the number buttons to enter digits.
2. Use the operation buttons (+, -, x, /) for arithmetic.
3. For advanced calculations, use Pow for exponents and % for percentages.
4. Use the π button to insert the value of Pi.
5. Press the "." button for decimal numbers.
6. Click the "=" button to display the result.
7. Use "AC" to clear the current input.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for parentheses and complex expressions.
- Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC).
- Introduce a history feature to track previous calculations.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure proper syntax when entering expressions.
- If the result is incorrect, clear and re-enter the expression.
- Decimal and special characters should only be used once per number.
